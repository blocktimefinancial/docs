### BTF Implementation Documentation

BTF implements the SEP-0001 protocol by placing a well formed TOML file adhering to the SEP-0001 spec in the clients home domain .well-known directory.

Any web browser or application can access the file by issuing a GET to the home domain/.well-known/stellar.toml

Here is a sample of the typical stellar.toml file received in the response in a text/plain format.

### Security

This endpoint, <home domain>/.well-known/stellar.toml, is open and publicly available. The BTF hosted managed stellar.toml files are load-balanced and rate-limited, and monitored for regulatory compliance.
