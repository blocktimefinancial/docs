## BTF Implementation of SEP-0008

### Link to the Stellar SEP-0008

[SEP-0008](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0008.md)

### BTF Implementation Documentation

### Overview

Implementing a regulated asset requires these parts:

- Issuer account with appropriate [authorization flags](#authorization-flags) set.
- [SEP-1 stellar.toml](#sep-0001-stellartoml) used for discovering [Approval Server](#approval-server).
- [Approval Server](#approval-server) that validates client transactions according to the service's approval criteria. Validated transactions are signed by the asset's issuing account.

### Authorization Flags

Regulated asset issuers must have both `Authorization Required` and `Authorization Revocable` flags set on their
account. This allows the issuer to grant and revoke authorization to transact the asset at will. In addition
the `Authorization ClawbackEnable` flag should be set for US regulated assets. THis allows the issuer to clawback or cancel assets for lost or stolen assets, legal or regulatory requirements.

### SEP-0001 stellar.toml

Issuers advertise the existence of an Approval Service through their [SEP-1 stellar.toml] file. This is done in the
`[[CURRENCIES]]` section as different assets can have different requirements.

### Fields:

These fields are listed in the `[[CURRENCIES]]` section:

- `regulated` is a boolean indicating whether or not this is a regulated asset. If missing, `false` is assumed.
- `approval_server` is the URL of an approval service that signs validated transactions.
- `approval_criteria` is a human readable string that explains the issuer's requirements for approving transactions.

### Example

```toml
[[CURRENCIES]]
code="ASSET1"
issuer="GD5T6IPRNCKFOHQWT264YPKOZAWUMMZOLZBJ6BNQMUGPWGRLBK3U7ZNP"
regulated=true
approval_server="https://dev.blocktimefinancial.com/api/tx_approve"
approval_criteria="The BTF approval server will ensure that transactions are compliant with SEC regulation"
```

### Approval Server

The Stellar SEP-0008 Approval Server is a single endpoint that receives a signed transaction, checks for compliance, and signs it on success. The BTF implementation adds additional endpoints that are detailed below.

The specification of an approval server is defined as follows:

### Cross-Origin Headers

Cross-origin requests to the endpoints in this specification must be supported by the server so that web clients from
other sites can use the endpoint(s). Valid CORS headers and requests that allow any domain origin to access the
endpoints in this specification are necessary. The following HTTP header and support of preflight OPTIONS requests are
the smallest change necessary. More complex headers configurations can be used.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

### Content Type

Approval server accepts requests in the following `Content-Type`s:

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `application/json`

Approval server responds with the `Content-Type`:

- `application/json`

### POST Endpoint /tx_approve

#### Request

This endpoint accepts HTTP POST requests containing a single `tx` parameter.

| Name | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tx` | string | A base64 encoded transaction envelope XDR signed by the user. This is the transaction that will be tested for compliance and signed on success. |

###### Example (JSON)

```json
{
  "tx": "AAAAAHAHhQtYBh5F2zA6..."
}
```

###### Example (Form)

```
tx=AAAAAHAHhQtYBh5F2zA6...
```

#### Responses

All responses will contain a top level `status` parameter that indicates the type of the result.

##### Success

This response means that the transaction was found compliant and signed without being revised.

A `success` response will have a `200` HTTP status code and `success` as the `status` value.

Parameters:

| Name      | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`  | string | `"success"`                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `tx`      | string | Transaction envelope XDR, base64 encoded. This transaction will have both the original signature(s) from the request as well as one or multiple additional signatures from the issuer. |
| `message` | string | (optional) A human readable string containing information to pass on to the user.                                                                                                      |

###### Example

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "tx": "AAAAAHAHhQtYBh5F2zA6..."
}
```

##### Rejected

This response means that the transaction is not compliant and could not be revised to be made compliant.

A `rejected` response will have a `400` HTTP status code and `rejected` as the `status` value.

Parameters:

| Name     | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
| -------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status` | string | `"rejected"`                                                                                             |
| `error`  | string | A human readable string explaining why the transaction is not compliant and could not be made compliant. |

###### Example

```json
{
  "status": "rejected",
  "error": "The destination account is blocked."
}
```

##### Revised

This is not supported at this point. There are some liability issues with changing a user's transaction.

##### Pending

This is not supported. The Approval Server will either sign a transaction or reject with error message

##### Action Required

This is not supported. The Approval Server will either sign a transaction or reject with error message in this case it the message will be what action needs to be taken to approve the transaction.

### BTF Extensions to SEP-0008

### POST Endpoint /swap_tx

#### Request

This endpoint accepts HTTP POST requests containing an array of payments. Each payment has four required parameters and one optional source parameter. The payment parameters are to, from, asset, amount, and the optional source. If the swap transaction results in an uneven transfer, this will be noted in the "message" parameter. If the transaction is valid, the endpoint will return the user an issuer signed base64 transaction. The user will need to pass the transaction to the appropriate signing parties before submitting it to the network for execution.

| Name        | Type   | Description                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tx_source` | string | The source account for the transaction. The sequence number from this account will be used for the transaction. |
| `payments`  | array  | A JSON array of payments that will result in a swap or trade of two or more assets.                             |

###### Example (JSON)

```json
{
  "tx_source": "",
  "payments": [
    { "to": "", "from": "", "asset": "", "amount": "", "source": "" }
  ]

| `tx`      | string | Transaction envelope XDR, base64 encoded. This transaction will a signature from the issuer and will be wrapped with the appropriate trust operations where needed. The user(s) will need to sign transaction before submitting to a transaction service. |

### Security

Any user will need to authenticate with SEP-0010 prior to using these endpoints. See the SEP-0010 documentation for more information.
