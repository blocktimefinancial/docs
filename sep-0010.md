## BTF Implementation of SEP-0010

### Link to the Stellar SEP-0010

[SEP-0010](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md)

### BTF Implementation Documentation

BTF also uses an encrypted JWT token for authentication. BTF keeps the token in the x-btf-auth-token header so as not to conflict with the SEP-0010 JWT token in the 'Authorization' header.

### Security

BTF may implement an access control list for verified IP addresses in order to authenticate against these endpoints.
