Yes, you can refine the permissions to grant a user and group access to the Let's Encrypt certificates for a _specific_ subdomain. Let's say your subdomain is `api.example.com`, and you want to give the user `apiuser` access to its certificates.

Here's the modified procedure:

**1. Create the Group:**

- Create the `api-cert-access` group, specific to this subdomain:

  ```bash
  sudo groupadd api-cert-access
  ```

**2. Change Ownership and Permissions for the Subdomain's Certificate Directory:**

- Change the group ownership of the specific subdomain's `live` and `archive` directories to `api-cert-access`:

  ```bash
  sudo chgrp api-cert-access /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.com/
  sudo chgrp api-cert-access /etc/letsencrypt/archive/api.example.com/
  ```

- Change the permissions of the `live` and `archive` directories and their contents for that subdomain, allowing group read access:

  ```bash
  sudo chmod -R g+r /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.com/
  sudo chmod -R g+r /etc/letsencrypt/archive/api.example.com/
  ```

  **2.5 Added Change Ownership and Permissions for the Subdomain's Certificate Directory:**
  We need this step also

```bash
sudo chown root:btfapi-access /etc/letsencrypt/live/
sudo chown root:btfapi-access /etc/letsencrypt/archive/
```

```bash
sudo chmod 750 /etc/letsencrypt/live/
sudo chmod 750 /etc/letsencrypt/archive/
```

**3. Add the `apiuser` User to the Group:**

- Add the `apiuser` user to the `api-cert-access` group:

  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG api-cert-access apiuser
  ```

**4. Verify Group Membership:**

- Verify that the `apiuser` user is in the `api-cert-access` group:

  ```bash
  groups apiuser
  ```

**5. Test Access:**

- Log in as the `apiuser` user (or use `sudo -u apiuser bash`) and try to read the certificate files for `api.example.com`:

  ```bash
  cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.com/fullchain.pem
  ```

  If you can read the file, the permissions are set up correctly.

**Important Considerations for `api.example.com` and the `apiuser` User:**

- **Scoped Permissions:**
  - This approach restricts the `apiuser` to only the certificates for `api.example.com`. They won't have access to certificates for other domains or subdomains.
- **Minimal Access:**
  - Grant the minimum necessary permissions. In this case, read-only access is sufficient.
- **Security:**
  - Even with scoped permissions, treat the private keys with care. Secure the `apiuser` account.
- **Renewal:**
  - Certbot renewals, which run as `root`, will not be affected.
- **Web Application Service Account:**
  - If the web application running `api.example.com` runs as a specific service account, it is better to add that service account to the `api-cert-access` group instead of giving the `apiuser` shell access.
- **Future Subdomains:**
  - If you add more subdomains, you'll need to repeat these steps for each one, creating new groups and assigning permissions accordingly.
